Invokes Web WorldWind without using the internet. Refers to only data stored locally on the web server.

To deploy:
- Download https://worldwind32.arc.nasa.gov/WebWorldWind-StandaloneData.tar.gz and unzip it into the top-level
  directory so that the "standalonedata" directory is a peer of examples and worldwind.min.js.
- Ensure that your web server is configured to send an HTTP content type of application/octet-stream
  or application/bil16 for files with a .bil suffix. You can do this for Apache servers by adding bil
  to the list of application-octet-stream suffixes in the mime.types file and then restarting the server.
- Use your browser to invoke this HTML file, the one you're now reading, via the web server. Do not attempt
  to open it using the browser's File->Open menu. Use an http or https URL with the server address.

If deployment was successful then you should see a Web WorldWind globe in the browser. The globe
should have blue marble imagery all over it and greenish Landsat imagery over most of North America.

If you zoom into a mountainous region you should see the raised mountains. There are no elevations
included for the oceans, so they are all flat.

Be sure that the "../standalonedata" directory exists (relative to this file) and that it contains the Blue Marble
imagery, the Landsat imagery and the DTED0 elevations in its Earth directory.
